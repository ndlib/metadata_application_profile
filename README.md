# Metadata Application Profile

The goal of this repo is to allow both our cataloging guidelines and our repository data model to be drive from the same source.
This requires that the structured data be extracted from the [original document][1].

It also contains mappings to the [DC terms][2] as defined by the [RDF gem][3].
